ng generate component [component name]
if you want to do an array, create it in the typescript file
in the export class
To display, you need to set it up in AppComponent.html
This is the top level "single" page that displays
use the "selector" from [component name.ts] <app-dungeon></app-dungeon>
ngmodel is the mechanism by which Angular stores data for use in components
   ngmodel needs to be used with a button and function

[(ngmodel)] is used for real time updates (LOVE THIS!)
